# AI Blog Post Generator from YouTube Link

This project is a Python Django-based web application that generates comprehensive blog articles from YouTube video transcripts. By leveraging various powerful libraries and APIs such as PyTube, AssemblyAI, and AI21, this tool extracts audio from YouTube videos, transcribes it, and generates well-formatted blog posts. The application runs on a PostgreSQL database in the background to ensure robust data handling and storage.

## Features
